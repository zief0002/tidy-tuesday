Here are some Tidy Tuesday activities.


## February 01, 08, and 15, 2021

You will get a chance to re-create features from the bubble plot featured on Gapminder.org. You can also try adding emoji to a plot, using the `{ggtext}` package to make fancy titles and text, and try creating an animated plot!

- [Activity (HTML)](worksheets/tidy-tuesday-2021-02-01.html) [Updated 2021-02-02 to include links to the emoGG package]
- [RMD File](worksheets/tidy-tuesday-2021-02-01.Rmd)

The meeting on February 08 will be a working meeting where you can collaborate with others to on these problems. On February 15, you can share the plots you made with others as we celebrate your effort!
