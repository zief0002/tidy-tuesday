The ICD Tidy Tuesday group is run and attended by a bunch of really smart graduate students, post-docs, and personnel from the [Institute of Child Development](https://icd.umn.edu/) at the University of Minnesota (with some help from Andy).

Inspired by the [Tidy Tuesday Social Data Project](https://thomasmock.netlify.app/post/tidytuesday-a-weekly-social-data-project-in-r/), the goal of this group is to promote members' computational skills, especially those for working with data. This group is about community, and we learn from each other.
