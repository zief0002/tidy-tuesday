For this Tidy Tuesday we will try to recreate the Life Expectancy versus Income bubble plot featured at [Gapminder.org](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/). To orient you to the data, visit the site and check out the attributes that are being displayed in the plot. Perhaps read the "data doubts" to understand some of the complications associated with measuring these attributes. Hit the "play" button and watch how the relationship between Life Expectancy versus Income changes over time.


The data we will use for the actual Tidy Tuesday activity are a dataset that is internal to the `{gapminder}` package. This dataset includes a subset of the actual Gapminder data. For example, it only includes certain measures and only those measurements from 1952 to 2007.^[More complete data can be download from [Gapminder directly](https://www.gapminder.org/data/), although you would need to join several datasets together and also need to transform it to the long format.]

1. Recreate the bubble plot for the year 1982^[Why 1982? Because it was the year E.T. was released.]. Try to mimic this plot as closely as you can, including all the guides on the plot, labels, and the color palette.

2. Create a scatterplot of the life expectancy versus income for the year 1982. But use emoji rather than points to mark the observations in the plot. There are several packages that you could use to do this. Here is a link to the [emoGG documentation](https://github.com/dill/emoGG), which is one package to do this with.^[Also check out the [emo package](https://github.com/hadley/emo) to display emoji in the R Console or in your R Markdown document.] 

<br />

3. Try out some features of the `{ggtext}` package (see [here](https://github.com/wilkelab/ggtext)) to ninja-fy your plot (e.g., add images to the labels, color text in the title).

4. Use the `{gganimate}` package (see [here](https://gganimate.com/articles/gganimate.html)) to mimic the animation on Gapminder.com to show how the plot of life expectancy versus income changes over time.
